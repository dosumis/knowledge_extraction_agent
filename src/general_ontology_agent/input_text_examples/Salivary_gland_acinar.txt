Acinar cells of the salivary gland are a critical part of the oral physiology and the digestive mechanism. These specialized cells are concentrated towards the terminal ends of the salivary glands, where they form sac-like acini or clusters. The primary function of these cells is to produce and secrete saliva. This substance, comprised mainly of water, electrolytes, mucins, and enzymes, is vital for the initial stages of digestion and for the regular maintenance of oral health.  Acinar cells produce the two main types of saliva: serous and mucinous. Serous saliva contains the enzyme amylase responsible for the initial breakdown of complex carbohydrates and is predominantly produced by the parotid gland, the largest of salivary glands. The mucinous type, more common in the submandibular and sublingual glands, contains mucin that aids in lubrication, facilitating the process of mastication and bolus formation. Moreover, acinar cells also express and respond to various endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine hormones that govern the quantity and composition of the saliva produced. This implies sensitivity and modulation according to the internal and external environment, dietary habits, and even circadian rhythms. Impairment of acinar cells, whether due to damage or related to a systemic condition such as Sj√∂gren's Syndrome, can disrupt the optimal functioning of the oral and digestive systems. In conclusion, acinar cells of the salivary gland have a substantial role in oral health and overall homeostasis.
