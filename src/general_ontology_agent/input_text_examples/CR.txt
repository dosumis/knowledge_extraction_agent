Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are a heterogeneous population of morphologically and molecularly distinct reelin-producing neurons that play crucial roles in brain development. These small, non-GABAergic neurons are located in the marginal zone/layer I of the developing cerebral cortex and immature hippocampus, where they display characteristic horizontal orientations with processes parallel to the pial surface. Structurally, CR cells exhibit diverse morphologies including unipolar, bipolar, and stellate configurations, with horizontal axonal processes and ascending dendrites that can contact the pial surface. Functionally, these first-born cortical neurons secrete reelin, a glycoprotein essential for controlling dendritogenesis, neuronal migration, and cortical lamination during embryonic development. They also regulate the radial glial phenotype and provide critical signals for cortical circuit formation. In terms of developmental timeline, CR cells are generated very early in mice (embryonic days 10.5-12.5) and migrate tangentially through the marginal zone. While most CR cells undergo programmed cell death during the second postnatal week in the neocortex, a significant population persists in the hippocampus throughout adulthood. The most reliable molecular markers for identifying CR cells include p73 and calretinin, as reelin and COUP-TFII lack specificity due to expression in other neuronal populations. bnormalities in Cajal-Retzius cell structure, function, and development are implicated in numerous neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological phenotypes. CR cell dysfunction has been associated with major psychiatric and developmental conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, lissencephaly, and temporal lobe epilepsy. Genetic alterations in the RELN gene, which encodes the reelin protein produced by CR cells, have been specifically linked to autism susceptibility through GCC repeats in the 5â€²UTR and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Experimental studies preventing normal CR cell death reveal severe consequences for brain function, including hippocampus-dependent memory impairments, attenuated theta oscillations, enhanced gamma activity, and increased susceptibility to seizures. Additionally, aberrant CR cell survival leads to cortical circuit abnormalities characterized by layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron hyper-excitability, excitation/inhibition imbalances, delayed learning, and reduced performance in sensory discrimination tasks. These findings underscore the critical importance of proper CR cell elimination during development for establishing functional cortical networks and highlight how disruption of this precisely orchestrated process can contribute to various neurological and psychiatric disorders.
