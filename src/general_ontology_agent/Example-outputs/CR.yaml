        Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are a heterogeneous population of morphologically and 
        molecularly distinct reelin-producing neurons that play crucial roles in brain 
        development. These small, non-GABAergic neurons are located in the marginal zone/layer
        I of the developing cerebral cortex and immature hippocampus, where they display 
        characteristic horizontal orientations with processes parallel to the pial surface.
        Structurally, CR cells exhibit diverse morphologies including unipolar, bipolar, and 
        stellate configurations, with horizontal axonal processes and ascending dendrites 
        that can contact the pial surface. Functionally, these first-born cortical neurons
        secrete reelin, a glycoprotein essential for controlling dendritogenesis, neuronal 
        migration, and cortical lamination during embryonic development. They also regulate 
        the radial glial phenotype and provide critical signals for cortical circuit formation.
        Abnormalities in Cajal-Retzius cell structure, function, and development are implicated
        in numerous neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological phenotypes. CR cell 
        dysfunction has been associated with major psychiatric and developmental conditions 
        including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, lissencephaly, 
        and temporal lobe epilepsy.
